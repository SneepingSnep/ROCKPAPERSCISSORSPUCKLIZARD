In this weeks project. I have made a game of RPSSL in c. Where i have used getchar in a new way, where i continues read the input untill something i want is read.
I have used switch cases
I have used enum type

The game of RPSSL is a game like rock paper scissor but with two additional shapes.
You chose to play in the start menu
After that you are prompted to choose a shape, and the game goes on from there. where your score is summed up after eacb part of the game.
Whoever gets to 5 points first. IE. wins 5 times first. Will win the whole game
